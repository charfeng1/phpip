# AI Service Hosting Options: Managed vs Self-Hosted

## TL;DR

**Can you build serverless yourself?** Yes, but it's complex and not worth it.

**Recommended approach:**
1. **Start simple:** Traditional Node.js on your server ($0 extra cost)
2. **Scale later:** Move to managed serverless when traffic grows
3. **Or use managed from start:** If you want auto-scaling now ($15-25/month)

---

## Option 1: Traditional Self-Hosted (Easiest Start)

### Just Run Node.js on Your Server

You don't NEED serverless! Start with a simple Node.js service on your existing server.

```bash
# On your server (where Laravel runs)
cd /var/www/phpip-ai-service
npm install
npm run build

# Run with PM2 (process manager)
pm2 start dist/main.js --name phpip-ai
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ No additional costs (uses existing server)
- ✅ Simple deployment
- ✅ Always warm (no cold starts)
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Easy debugging (just check logs)

**What you don't get:**
- ❌ Manual scaling (if traffic grows, you add servers manually)
- ❌ Always running (even if idle)
- ❌ You manage everything (OS updates, security, monitoring)

**Cost:** $0 extra (or $20-40/month if you need bigger server)

### Architecture

```
Your Server:
├── Apache/Nginx (port 80/443) → Laravel
├── PM2 → Node.js AI Service (port 3000)
└── MySQL

Laravel calls: http://localhost:3000/api/review
```

**This is perfectly fine for:**
- MVP and testing
- <1,000 AI requests/day
- Single server deployment
- When you want simplicity

---

## Option 2: Self-Hosted "Serverless" (Advanced, Not Recommended)

### Build Your Own Serverless Platform

You CAN build serverless infrastructure yourself using open-source tools.

#### Tools Available:

**1. OpenFaaS**
```yaml
# Self-hosted function-as-a-service
# Runs on Docker/Kubernetes
# You manage everything
```

**2. Knative**
```yaml
# Kubernetes-based serverless
# Auto-scaling, scale-to-zero
# Complex setup
```

**3. Fission**
```yaml
# Kubernetes-native serverless framework
# Similar to Lambda but self-hosted
```

### Example: OpenFaaS Setup

```bash
# Install on your server (requires Docker)
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faas
cd faas
docker swarm init
./deploy_stack.sh

# Deploy your AI function
faas-cli deploy --image=phpip-ai:latest --name=review-agent
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Serverless-like features (auto-scaling, scale-to-zero)
- ✅ No vendor lock-in
- ✅ Full control over infrastructure

**What you DON'T get:**
- ❌ You manage Kubernetes cluster (complex!)
- ❌ You handle scaling, networking, monitoring
- ❌ You maintain infrastructure (updates, security)
- ❌ No built-in load balancer, HTTPS, CDN
- ❌ Requires DevOps expertise

**Cost:**
- Time: 40-80 hours to set up properly
- Server: $100-200/month (need bigger servers for Kubernetes)
- Maintenance: Ongoing

**Reality Check:** This is only worth it if you're:
- Running 100+ services (not just one AI service)
- Have dedicated DevOps team
- Need to avoid cloud providers for compliance reasons

**For your use case:** Complete overkill, not recommended.

---

## Option 3: Managed Serverless (Recommended for Production)

### Use Cloud Provider (Google Cloud Run, AWS Lambda)

Let experts handle infrastructure, you focus on code.

**Providers:**

### Google Cloud Run (Best for Your Use Case)

```bash
# Deploy in one command
gcloud run deploy phpip-ai \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1
```

**Managed by Google:**
- ✅ Auto-scaling (0 to 1000+ instances)
- ✅ HTTPS, load balancing, CDN
- ✅ Security patches, OS updates
- ✅ Monitoring, logging built-in
- ✅ 99.95% uptime SLA

**You manage:**
- Your application code
- Environment variables
- That's it!

**Cost:** $15-25/month (pay per use)

### AWS Lambda (Alternative)

```javascript
// Lambda function
export const handler = async (event) => {
  const result = await reviewAgent.review(event.matterId);
  return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(result) };
};
```

**Managed by AWS:**
- Same benefits as Cloud Run
- More complex setup
- Better AWS integration

**Cost:** Similar to Cloud Run

## What Can You Build Yourself?

### ✅ Easy to Build Yourself

**1. The AI Service Application (This is what you build!)**

```
phpip-ai-service/
├── src/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── review-agent.ts      ← You build this
│   │   ├── chat-agent.ts        ← You build this
│   │   └── search-agent.ts      ← You build this
│   ├── controllers/             ← You build this
│   ├── services/                ← You build this
│   └── main.ts                  ← You build this
├── Dockerfile                   ← Simple (10 lines)
└── package.json
```

**Your work:**
- Write AI agent logic (LangChain, OpenAI integration)
- Build API endpoints (NestJS controllers)
- Database connections (TypeORM)
- Business logic specific to phpIP

**This is your core value - focus here!**

### ❌ Hard to Build Yourself (Use Managed)

**2. Serverless Infrastructure**

What managed platforms give you that's HARD to build:

```

│ This requires full DevOps team                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Building this yourself:** Months of work + ongoing maintenance

**Using managed:** Already done for you

## Recommended Path for phpIP

### Phase 1: Start Simple (Week 1)

**Use self-hosted traditional deployment**

```bash
# On your server
cd /var/www/phpip-ai-service
npm install
pm2 start dist/main.js

# Laravel calls
http://localhost:3000/api/review
```

**Why:**
- Get started immediately
- Test AI features with real users
- $0 additional cost
- Simple debugging

**Limitations:**
- Single server (no auto-scaling)
- Always running (even if idle)

**Good for:** MVP, testing, <1,000 requests/day

---

### Phase 2: Prove Value (Months 1-3)

**Keep running on self-hosted**

During this time:
- Get user feedback
- Measure usage patterns
- See if AI features are valuable
- Calculate ROI

**Metrics to track:**
- Requests per day
- Peak concurrent requests
- Cost of running (server resources)
- User satisfaction

---

### Phase 3: Scale with Managed (Month 4+)

**Move to Cloud Run when:**
- >1,000 AI requests/day
- Need better reliability
- Want to reduce maintenance
- Traffic is bursty (busy during day, idle at night)

**Migration is simple:**

```bash
# 1. Add Dockerfile (10 lines)
FROM node:20
COPY . /app
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]

# 2. Deploy (one command)
gcloud run deploy phpip-ai --source .

# 3. Update Laravel
AI_SERVICE_URL=https://phpip-ai-xyz.run.app
```

**Benefits at this stage:**
- Auto-scaling (handles growth automatically)
- Better reliability (99.95% uptime)
- Less maintenance (Google handles infrastructure)
- Cost-effective (pay per use)

---

## Real Talk: What You Actually Need

### For Your Specific Use Case

**You're adding AI to an existing law firm IP management system.**

**Realistic traffic:**
- 5-10 paralegals using the system
- 100-500 matter submissions per month
- 50-100 searches per day
- 20-30 chat conversations per day

**This is LOW traffic!**

**Best option:** Self-hosted traditional Node.js

```
Your server:
├── Laravel phpIP
└── Node.js AI Service (PM2)

Cost: $0 extra (or $10-20/month for slightly bigger server)
```

**When to upgrade:** If you grow to 50+ users or 5,000+ requests/day

---

## What You Should Build vs Use

### ✅ Build Yourself (Your Core Value)

```typescript
// AI agent logic - this is YOUR competitive advantage
class ReviewAgent {
  async review(matter: Matter): Promise<ReviewResult> {
    // YOUR BUSINESS LOGIC:
    // - What makes a good patent application?
    // - What fields are required?
    // - What are common mistakes?
    // - How to provide helpful feedback?

    // This is specific to YOUR law firm
    // This is what you SHOULD spend time on
  }
}
```

### ❌ Don't Build (Use Managed)

```typescript
// Infrastructure - let experts handle this
- Auto-scaling logic
- Load balancing
- HTTPS certificates
- DDoS protection
- Monitoring dashboards
- Log aggregation
- Container orchestration

// These are generic, not specific to your business
// Use Cloud Run / AWS Lambda / etc.
```

---

## Cost Reality Check

### Self-Hosted Traditional

**Month 1-12:**
- Server cost: $0-40/month
- Your time: 10 hours setup + 2 hours/month maintenance
- Total: ~$40/month + your time

### Self-Hosted Serverless (OpenFaaS/Knative)

**Month 1:**
- Setup time: 40-80 hours
- Server cost: $100-200/month (bigger servers for Kubernetes)
- Learning curve: High

**Month 2-12:**
- Maintenance: 10 hours/month
- Server cost: $100-200/month
- Total: ~$150/month + significant time

### Managed Serverless (Cloud Run)

**Month 1-12:**
- Setup time: 1 hour
- Platform cost: $15-25/month
- Maintenance: ~0 hours/month (Google handles it)
- Total: ~$20/month + almost no time

---

## My Recommendation

### Start Here (Week 1):

```bash
# Traditional self-hosted on your server
npm install
pm2 start dist/main.js
```

**Cost:** $0
**Time:** 1 hour
**Works for:** 100-1,000 requests/day

### Upgrade When Needed (6-12 months later):

```bash
# Managed serverless (Cloud Run)
gcloud run deploy phpip-ai --source .
```

**Cost:** $15-25/month
**Time:** 1 hour to migrate
**Works for:** 1,000-100,000+ requests/day

### Don't Do This:

```bash
# Self-hosted serverless (OpenFaaS/Knative)
# Unless you have specific requirements
```

**Cost:** $150/month + significant time
**Time:** 40-80 hours setup + ongoing maintenance
**Only worth it if:** You're running 50+ services and have DevOps team

---

## Simple Decision Tree

```
Do you have <1,000 AI requests/day?
├─ Yes → Self-hosted traditional Node.js ($0-40/month)
└─ No → Keep reading

Do you have DevOps team?
├─ No → Managed serverless (Cloud Run) ($15-25/month)
└─ Yes → Keep reading

Do you run 50+ microservices?
├─ No → Managed serverless (Cloud Run) ($15-25/month)
└─ Yes → Self-hosted serverless might make sense

Do you have compliance requirements preventing cloud use?
├─ Yes → Self-hosted serverless (OpenFaaS) ($150/month)
└─ No → Managed serverless (Cloud Run) ($15-25/month)
```

**For phpIP:** Self-hosted traditional → later upgrade to managed serverless

---

## Summary

**Q: Do I need a managed service or can I build it myself?**

**A: You CAN build it yourself, but you SHOULDN'T.**

**What you SHOULD build:**
- ✅ AI agent logic (your business value)
- ✅ Integration with phpIP
- ✅ Prompt engineering for legal/patent domain
- ✅ Review rules and validation logic

**What you should USE (not build):**
- ✅ Node.js runtime (existing)
- ✅ TypeScript/LangChain (existing libraries)
- ✅ Infrastructure (managed service OR simple PM2)

**Start simple:**
1. Week 1: Deploy Node.js with PM2 on your server ($0)
2. Month 1-3: Test with real users
3. Month 4+: Move to Cloud Run if you need auto-scaling ($20/month)

**Don't build:** Serverless platform from scratch (not worth it for one service)

**Focus your energy on:** Making AI agents that understand legal/patent work, not building Kubernetes clusters!
