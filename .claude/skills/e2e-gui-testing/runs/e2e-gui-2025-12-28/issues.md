## Observations (Not Bugs)

### Observation 1: Empty Task List
**Type**: Expected Behavior
**Location**: /task page
**Description**: Task list page appears blank/empty

**Analysis**: This is expected behavior - the dashboard confirms "0 TOTAL TASKS" in the system. No tasks have been seeded in the database.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding task seed data for more comprehensive testing.

### Observation 2: Empty Renewals List
**Type**: Expected Behavior
**Location**: /renewal page
**Description**: Renewals list shows "The list is empty"

**Analysis**: Expected since no renewal tasks exist. Renewal tasks are generated by rules when events occur.

**Recommendation**: Could seed renewal tasks for testing the full renewal workflow.

### Observation 3: Matter ID Sequence
**Type**: Data Observation
**Location**: /matter/{id} routes
**Description**: Matter IDs start at 2 (not 1), ranging from 2-10 for the 9 seeded matters.

**Analysis**: Normal behavior - ID 1 may have been deleted or IDs are assigned based on seeding order.

**Recommendation**: None needed.
